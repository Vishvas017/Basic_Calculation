1) Write a script to declare a variable name and assign it your name. Display the value of the variable using console.log.

2) Declare a variable age and assign it your age. Then, change the value of age to 5 years older. Print both the original and updated values.

3) Declare two variables, firstName and lastName. Assign them your first and last name respectively. Concatenate them into a single variable fullName and print it.

4) Declare a variable num and assign it the value 10. Multiply it by 5 and print the result.

5) Declare two variables, x and y, and assign them the values 8 and 3 respectively. Compute and print the result of x + y, x - y, x * y, and x / y.

6) Declare a variable temperature with an initial value of 20. Reassign it to a string value "twenty degrees". Print the variable before and after reassignment to observe type coercion.
